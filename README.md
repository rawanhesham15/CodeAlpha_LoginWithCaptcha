<p> <b> 3- Why Your Site Needs a Captcha? </b> </p>
<p> - Preventing Fake Registration: Spambots search thoroughly the internet finding signup forms to fill in. Captcha will help these sites distinguish between a human and a bot, so this automated computer program can’t penetrate your website through the registration form. </p>
<p> - Preventing Spam Comments: Many spammers bombard comment sections in an effort to drive a high clickthrough rate of their websites and raise the search engine ranks. </p>
<p> - Making Online Shopping More Secure:  Competitors may use invalid names, emails, shipping addresses to order your products; as a result, you will waste time and money to deliver products to no one. </p>
<p> - Protecting Email Accounts: Hackers will repeatedly attempt to log in to an email account by trying hundreds of different passwords. To prevent these bad guys from stealing accounts someday, Gmail asks its users to fill a captcha form to reduce the risks of losing their accounts. </p>

<p> <b> 5- No captcha Recaptcha: </b> which i used in my webiste here The users are presented with a checkbox indicating “I am not a robot” and they just simply click it. This method tracks the movement and figures. Bots that are very methodical are more likely to check the box right in the middle while humans tend to click in some other areas of the box. Users can complete this task with no effort but it proves very difficult for bots. No captcha Recaptcha is incredibly effective and accurate. However, as the first test fails, there is another test requiring users to choose all the related images from the following section or type some combinations of numbers or letters. The following test can make the users unpleasant. </p>
